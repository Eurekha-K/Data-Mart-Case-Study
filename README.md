# Data-Mart-Case-Study

This project aims to quantify the impact of a significant supply chain change at Data Mart, a business venture within Data Dart. In June 2020, Data Mart transitioned to fully sustainable packaging methods across its entire supply chain, from farm to customer. The goal is to understand how this change affected sales performance for Data Mart and its various business areas.

# Key Objectives:

## Measure Sales Impact: Quantify the change in sales revenue and volume for Data Mart and its individual business areas before and after the sustainable packaging implementation.
Identify Trends: Analyze any trends or patterns in sales data to understand how customer behavior may have shifted in response to the change.
Evaluate Customer Preferences: Determine if the shift to sustainable packaging had a positive or negative impact on customer preferences and purchasing decisions.
Assess Business Area Performance: Compare the sales performance of different business areas within Data Mart to identify any disparities or areas of strength.
Data Analysis Approach:

## Data Preparation: Clean and prepare the weekly_sales dataset by creating a new table, clean_weekly_sales, with additional columns for week_number, month_number, calendar_year, age_band, demographic, and avg_transaction.
## Time Series Analysis: Analyze sales data over time to identify trends and patterns, focusing on periods before and after the sustainable packaging change.
Segmentation Analysis: Analyze sales data by age_band and demographic to understand how different customer segments responded to the change.
Comparative Analysis: Compare sales performance for different business areas within Data Mart to identify any variations.
Expected Outcomes:

##  Quantified Impact: A clear understanding of the financial impact of the sustainable packaging change on Data Mart's overall sales and individual business areas.
Customer Insights: Insights into how customer preferences and behavior may have shifted in response to the change.
Business Area Performance: Identification of any strengths or weaknesses in the performance of different business areas.
